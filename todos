General
[x] Update logo on all pages . Final logo is called Final logo in Figma
[x] Change away from sticky navbar so it does not follow on scroll (only front page)
[x] Link to Twitter in footer (https://twitter.com/untitled_so)

Update front page
[x] Redesign to match Web-Final-Layout in Figma. Remember to also reflect changes on mobile and tablet. Instead of using 3 cards on mobile, you can use one.
[x] Introduce hover states as indicated on Web-Final-Layout

Login page
[x] Introduce hover state on button (Darker color on hover).
[x] Add padding-top on mobile since the illustration is too close to the top (https://imgur.com/a/IAkVu3k)

Username page
[] Update designs as reflected in Figma
[] UX should be as follows:
[] Default shows empty input and the chef illustration.
[] If user inputs a taken username, we show the red cross and the error copy "This URL is taken".
[] User can click the red cross to clear input and focus caret on input again
[] If user inputs an availbale username, chef illustration slides out and karate man comes in instead. The button text changes to "Next" instead of check since username is available.

Creation page
[] Copy is not placed correctly (https://imgur.com/a/2igatbL)
[] Large screens look a bit funny (https://imgur.com/a/ErybSiA). Ideally, if we have larger screens, we add the space in the left and right side not in the middle. This could be a general problem across the site.

Profile page
[x] Missing: Placeholder while dragging and dropping
[x] New paddings and background color for profile page (example in Figma on New profile page final)
[x] UX bug: It's really hard to scroll through the profile page on mobile because even the slightest touch on a card starts re-ordering. Can we make it so that the user has to hold the card for a second or two before it starts reordering?
